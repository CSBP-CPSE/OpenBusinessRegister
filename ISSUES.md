# Issues
  - Removing the requirement for a header (mainly needed for XML parsing)
  - Hash table construction to be set as a function in `parser.py`
  - Require `for` loop in hash table definition to assign empty strings to non-existent fields
  - Handle column merging in MySQL appropriately
  - Handle replacing old data sets with new ones appropriately
